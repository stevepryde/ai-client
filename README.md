# ai-client
Client API for accessing various AI services

This is highly experimental while I figure out a nice API.

It also needs a catchy name.

## High level plans (if it ever gets there)

Support various LLMs using a simple interface.

Currently targeting Gemini but it would be cool to add others.

## Minimum Supported Rust Version

The MSRV for this crate is likely to be close to the latest at least for now.
